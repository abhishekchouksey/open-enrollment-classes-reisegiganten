This site is a collaboration between the GitHub Training Team and anyone that wants to learn
how to use Git and GitHub.

The site's [main page](../index.html) is a collection of where each person that's taken our training courses lives.

We invite you to add yourself to the map taking one of our [on-demand classes](https://github.github.com/on-demand/).
